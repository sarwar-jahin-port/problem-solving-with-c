-- Some Issues
    1. URI has turned to beecrowd.
    2. There could be junks.

-- Some Features
    1. Firstly, problem solving oriented.
       -- Once solved enough problems on a topic, then more detailed started (example: first 22 problems are all about solving problems from beecrowd.)
    2. Beecrowd easy problems and newcomer sheets are covered.
    3. Final project with file system.

    // Better way to watch
        1. Understanding the memes - better quality meme images are given in every video description. Follow that drive link to get a better view.
            -- There are memes in the thumbnails! Links are also provided!! (example: )
            -- Watch before watching the video and after watching the video
            -- There could be assignment to suggest memes!!!
            --  Many of my friends do not code now.
                But they still follow meme pages related to coding.
                This is what this course is for.
        2. Watch sessions first
            -- Pause and ponder
            (example :S2 28:10: quiz on printf)
            -- try to solve b yourself first
                (example: S4(2/3) 32:48 - write code for max value)

        3. Solve assignments before watching next sessions
            -- Have a quick glance at the content of the solve sessions.
            If there are hints, ou may go for it.

        4. Watch the solve classes even after finish solving.
            -- there are important tips
            (example: SA16 - 4:50 TLE)

        5. Not all solutions are discussed.
            -- Take help from problem discussion group and in the class
